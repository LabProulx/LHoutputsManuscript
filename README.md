[___FiberPhotmetryDataAnalysis.ipynb___](./FiberPhotometryDataAnalysis.ipynb) notebook includes functions necessary to process, analyze, and visualize fiber photometry data. Using these functions, jupyter notebooks in the [rawData](./rawData) folder show all the steps of analysis from raw data to the final [source data](./sourceData) and plots used in the figures of the preprint. [sourceData](./sourceData) folder also includes jupyter notebooks showing stastical analysis done for the preprint.
