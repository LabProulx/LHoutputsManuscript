# Fiber Photometry Data Analysis

FiberPhotmetryDataAnalysis.ipynb notebook contains 3 class objects (_FiberPhotometryRecording_, _FiberPhotomentryTest_, and _FiberPhotometryExperiment_) and helper functions to analyze and visualize fiber photometry recordings.   

_FiberPhotometryRecording_ object allows to manipulate recordings from one mouse in a specific test. When the object is created, a user sets raw recordings of calcium-independent (_references_) and calcium dependent signals (_signals_), which were measured during one _trial_, in the form of python dictionary, where keys are names of the neural populations (further _outputs_) the signals were recorded. A user can also set _events_ in the form of dictionary, where keys are names of events (e.g. airpuff, consumption, etc.). The _events_ has to be 2D arrays of two columns, if an event has onset and offset, such as consumption, otherwise one column, e.g. for airpuff. A user can set different _measurements_ that were done along with fiber photometry recordings, such as mobility detection, in the form of nested dictionary, where first keys indicate names of the measurements, and second level of keys  -- their 'time' and 'values'. The object also requires the names of the _mouse_, _test_, and _trial_ in format of python strings

When _FiberPhotometryRecording_ object is created, a user can call functions to calculate dF/F signals (_getDFF()_) and peri-event traces (_getPerievents()_) around the _events_ indicated in the object. The created data can be further saved to a Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file (_saveRecording()_) and loaded from the file (_loadRecording()_). Recordings that have the same _test_ name are saved in the same group of the HDF file and can be accessed using _FiberPhotometryTest_.
